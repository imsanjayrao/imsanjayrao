### Hey there 😌

I’m Sanjay, a CSE undergrad who likes building systems that are actually useful — from backend services to mobile apps to research prototypes.

I care about accessibility, performance, and making tech that doesn’t just work, but makes sense for people.

- 🧠 Currently exploring: Emerging technologies with user-centered, ethical design  
- 🛠️ Tools I like: Go, Python, Flutter, Unity, React
